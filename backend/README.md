DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=yourpassword
DB_NAME=yourdbname
```

3. **Make/Activate your Venv and Install dependencies**:

cd into your backend!

Make your venv (only do this once, in the future you can skip this step):
```
python -m venv venv 
```

Activate your Venv. On macOS/Linux:
```
source venv/bin/activate
```
On Windows
```
venv\Scripts\activate
```

Then run: 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Run the backend**:
